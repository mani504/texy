Keras OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a high-level library that facilitates detecting and recognizing text in images.
It is a combination of two steps: text detection and text recognition. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing Keras OCR.

1. Text Detection
Architecture: Keras OCR uses CRAFT (Character Region Awareness for Text detection), a deep learning model designed to detect text regions in natural images.
Working: The CRAFT model identifies individual character regions and their links to form text lines. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and detection.

2. Text Recognition
Architecture: For text recognition, Keras OCR employs a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN).


cv2.inpaint is a method in OpenCV used for image restoration. It is primarily used to remove unwanted objects or imperfections (like scratches, text, or marks) from an image by filling them in with the surrounding texture or color patterns. The method works by reconstructing the missing or damaged parts of an image using information from the surrounding pixels.


Algorithm to use for inpainting. Available options:
cv2.INPAINT_TELEA: A fast inpainting method by Alexandru Telea. Works well for small regions.
cv2.INPAINT_NS: The Navier-Stokes based method. This method is slower but can produce smoother results for larger areas.


Navier-Stokes (INPAINT_NS):
Computes the gradients of surrounding pixels and propagates them into the missing area.
Works well for smooth surfaces.
Telea Method (INPAINT_TELEA):
A fast-marching method that fills in missing regions by extrapolating pixel colors along the edges and smoothing them.
